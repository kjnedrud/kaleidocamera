# Kaleidocamera

This is a fun experiemental project that uses `getUserMedia()` and triangle math to turn your camera into a kaleidoscope.

I started this back in 2013 when `getUserMedia()` was still a bleeding-edge feature. Browsers have come a long way since then, so it is much better supported than it used to be. I may still update it from time to time to fix bugs and improve features.

Note: Accessing the user's camera with `getUserMedia()` only works over HTTPS due to privacy/security concerns.
